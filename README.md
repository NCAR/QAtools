# QAtools
A Shiny app for data quality assurance testing.

This repository has the content for an extended Shiny app that provides functions to use when reviewing 
data files produced by NCAR/RAF research aircraft. The focus is on detecting problems with the 
measurements. The app includes an extended set of complementary tools, including a general tutorial,
methods for comparing to past projects, the generation of a standard set of review plots, a Kalman
filter for detecting errors from the INS, and additional tools like methods for adding variables to
the data files or performing various fits for empirical representations of variables like the angle of
attack.
