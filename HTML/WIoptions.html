“Options for Adding Wind Variables” Tab</h3>
<p>This tab can add four sets of variables to an existing netCDF
file:</p>
<ul>
	<li/>
<p>A new angle-of-attack based on a complementary-filter
	algorithm (AKY)and associated new vertical-wind variables WIY and
	WIF, the latter a high-pass-filtered version of WIY.</p>
	<li/>
<p>Angles of attack and sideslip, airspeed, and associated
	wind variables calculated using measurements from the gust pod.</p>
	<li/>
<p>A revised airspeed and associated wind variables calculated
	using the pitot-static sensor.</p>
	<li/>
<p>A rate-of-climb variable calculated using the hydrostatic
	equation and pressure measurements (ROC).</p>
</ul>
<p>To use this tab, select the project and flight and select the
checkboxes indicating which sets of variables are to be added to the
data files. Then click the “Run the Wind Options Processor”
button. You can also use the “Next” button to process the next
unprocessed flight, or the “All” button to process all flights
for a selected project. The resulting files are named with a “Y”
suffix following this pattern: “CSETrf01Y.nc”. Selecting an
already processed flight will reprocess that flight; selecting “All”
will process only flights that have not yet been processed. The
process takes several minutes per flight, so selecting &quot;All&quot;
can take an hour or more.</p>
<p>The WIF calculation will work for all projects, but for projects
preceding DEEPWAVE the WIY solution will produce unsatisfactory
results so that should not be used unless new calibration
coefficients for AKY are determined. The calibration coefficients for
AKY were determined from a combination of data from DEEPWAVE, CSET,
ORCAS, and SOCRATES This approach is documented in the Kalman Filter
technical note and in a more extensive memo referenced in that
technical note.</p>
<p>After processing has finished, the new variables can be displayed
in either time-history format or as histograms using the checkboxes
under &quot;Variables to plot&quot; and the drop-down menu that sets
the plot type. If the selected processing has not produced the
selected variable, an error will be displayed, but recovery from this
error is to simply uncheck the box for the unavailable variable.</p>
