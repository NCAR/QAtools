<p>This application includes these tabs:</p>
<ol>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-1002x1"></a><u><b>Background</b></u>
	information. This will be a general training section or tutorial
	with interactive features that will describe some procedures related
	to data assessment and handling, to include sections on calibration
	procedures, empirical representation developed by fitting,
	properties of regression and the Deming fit, response
	characteristics of sensors, and applications to facilitate such
	processes. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-1004x2"></a><u><b>Past
	Projects: </b></u><span style="text-decoration: none"><span style="font-weight: normal">A
	</span></span>compilation of characteristics of measurements from
	past projects that can aid in the assessment of problems. For
	example, the flight-dependent and project-dependent comparisons
	between ATX and AT_A, QCXC and QC_A, and TASX and TAS_A will give
	some guidance regarding what tolerance is expected, and differences
	among available INS outputs can help determine what range to expect
	in future projects. This will include methods for assessing the time
	response of sensors, spectral response, illustration of behavior
	when known problems occur, and generally what to look for during
	quality assessment of data. The properties included will be
	determined by interaction with project managers and others involved
	in quality control so that this can reflect their experience and
	provide tools useful to them. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><u><b>Tools:</b></u><span style="text-decoration: none">
	</span><span style="text-decoration: none"><span style="font-weight: normal">Tools</span></span>
	for fitting and automatic tests to determine if there are time
	shifts that need to be addressed or if something has caused the time
	shifts to drift during the flight. It will also be possible to
	assess the effects of using those fits or changing those time
	shifts. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><a name="x1-1008x4"></a><u><b>Review:</b></u>
	The review plots that have been generated automatically for recent
	projects, but with added capability to work with them interactively
	(to select different variables, time intervals, etc.).</p>
	<li/>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><u><b>Known Problems:</b></u> An
	automatic review section that can evaluate any flight or flight
	segment and search for recognizable problems. The program will be
	interactive, allowing a user to select a flight and time, specific
	tests or the entire set available, and tailor the searches if
	desired. The output will then be flagged periods with potential
	problems. 
	</p>
	<li/>
<p><a name="x1-1026x5"></a><u><b>Special Processing:</b></u>
	Perhaps a tab that allows running the Kalman filter and viewing its
	output. The value of this is that it assesses the estimated
	magnitude of errors in the INS attitude angles, so if subtle INS
	problems develop they can be detected early. Also, the ability to
	generate new variables and display them as if they were included in
	the original file (including easy access to ncplot with the new
	variables).</p>
</ol>
<p>The first tab under &quot;Background&quot; includes some
suggestions regarding how to use this tool to check the quality of
some specific measurements. For more information, see the User Guide
